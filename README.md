# Queen Problem Algorithm
This backtracking algorithm is able to find all solutions to the N queen problem. 

## How to use

The board size variable in the QueenProblem class holds the size of the board and number of queens to be placed on the board. The default is 8.

```java
...
private static final int boardSize = 8;
...
```

When the boardSize variable is set you can run the algorithm by using the QueenProblem as your Main class in the configuration. The algorithm will spit out all valid solutions to the problem.
